        as a parameter

      - The function "extendModel" is added to the

       brief notes about how to combine Thot with Pharaoh and
       Moses)

     - Thot incorporates a new parameter: -c, which allows to
       prune the translation table given a cutoff value for
       the count of the source phrases

     - Solved a bug in alig_op when using the -e option

     - "-no-invert" parameter of alig_op has changed. The new name
       is "-no-transpose"

     - Changed the name of the "flip_ef" utility, now its name is
       "flip_phr"

     - Changes in the return values of some functions, using
       constants defined in the file ErrorDefs.h

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Thot 2.1.0 Beta

     - MAJOR CHANGE: NbestTableNode no longer works with probabilities
       but with log-probabilities. This affects to the functions
       getNbestTransFor_s_() and getNbestTransFor_t_()

     - New option for thot and pbs_thot: -lex. The -lex option
       incorporates two new score components in the phrase table

     - The library of phrase models provides faster access to the model
       probabilities

     - Better implementation of the OrderedVector class

     - The tool "filter_ttable" has been incorporated to the
       distribution. "filter_ttable" is a new tool to filter phrase
       models in order to apply them in machine translation tasks

     - The tool "score_phr_ibm" has been incorporated to the
       distribution. "score_phr_ibm" adds lexical scores for the
       phrase pairs of a given phrase table. The lexical scores are
       calculated as the score for the viterbi alignment of IBM 1 model.

     - "make check" is replaced by "make installcheck" since the tool
       checks are to be executed after installing the package

     - Source and target sentences or phrases are no longer noted using
       the letters 'e' and 'f' respectively, which are replaced by 's'
       and 't'. The modifications affects the name of variables and
       functions

       Functions that have changed their names:

       a) The scoring functions defined in BasePhraseModel: pf_e_, pe_f_,
       have changed its names: ps_t_, pt_s_ ...

       b) Functions to obtain lists of translations

       The old functions cited above are maintained for backward
       compatibility

       Functions that have altered the order in which the source and
       target sentences are given:

       a) The functions defined in the "print_func" module

       b) Some function members declared in the "PhraseModel_From_WBA" and
       the "PhraseExtractionTable" classes. Three functions which were
       modified are declared as public functions:

       PhraseModel_From_WBA::obtainBestAlignment
       PhraseExtractionTable::extractConsistentPhrases
       PhraseExtractionTable::obtainPossibleSegmentations

     - Some data types and functions names have been changed in order to
       simplify and clarify the code:

       InvNbestTransTable -> PhraseNbestTransTable
       TransTableNodeData and InvTransTableNodeData -> PhraseTableNodeData
       BasePhraseModel::getNbestInvTransFor_t_() -> BasePhraseModel::getNbestTransFor_t_()
       PhraseDict::getInvTranslationsFor_t_() -> PhraseDict::getTranslationsFor_t_()

     - Solved a bug in ps_t_ function defined in "PhraseModel.cc"

     - Solved a bug in the alig_op tool. The bug could appear when
       using the -f option, specifically when the prefix for the output
       file contained directory components

     - The robustness of the alig_op tool has been increased due to a
       better management of the temporary files that are used internally

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Thot 2.1.1 Beta

     - Solved a portability issue with i/o functions

     - Bug fixed in the pbs_thot tool (reported by Soren Harder)

     - Faster compilation

     - Thot package now splits the library libphrase_model.a into two
       files:
         * libphrase_model.a
         * libnlp_common.a

       libphrase_model.a depends on libnlp_common.a, so both libraries
       are needed to access the functionality provided by the package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Thot 2.2.0 Beta

    - Solved a memory management bug in the PhraseExtractionTable class

    - Solved portability issues with 64 bit processors

    - Solved possible portability problems with locales

    - Added the utility "train_giza", which allows to easily train
      IBM models using the GIZA and the mkcls tools

    - Added a simple class diagram created with the program "dia" (see
      doc/class_diag.dia)

    - The hierarchy of phrase-based model classes has been modified.
      Two new classes have been added: BaseCountPhraseModel and
      BaseIncrPhraseModel.

      The following classes have changed their names:

    * PhraseModel -> _incrPhraseModel
    * PhraseModel_From_WBA -> WbaIncrPhraseModel
    * PhraseModelWBAParameters -> WbaIncrPhraseModelParams

    - Some function names in BasePhraseModel.h and BaseIncrPhraseModel.h
      have changed:

    * pt_s_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strPt_s_(.)
    * logpt_s_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strLogpt_s_(.)
    * ps_t_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strPs_t_(.)
    * logps_t_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strLogps_t_(.)
    * getTransFor_s_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strGetTransFor_s_(.)
    * getTransFor_t_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strGetTransFor_t_(.)
    * getNbestTransFor_s_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strGetNbestTransFor_s_(.)
    * getNbestTransFor_t_(const Vector<string> ...) -> strGetNbestTransFor_t_(.)
    * addTableEntry(const Vector<string> ...) -> strAddTableEntry(.)
    * incrCountsOfEntry(const Vector<string> ...) -> strIncrCountsOfEntry(.)
